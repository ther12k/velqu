# M26-010-Z — Package evidence for Close route-count cold-start evidence

## Atomic goal

Create source-backed evidence and handoff for parent task M26-010; update status only if verification passed.

## Parent intent

Demonstrate flatter startup scaling and preserve small-app behavior.

## Dependencies

- `M26-010-V` — `tasks/03_m26_qpack_v2/M26-010-V-verify-close-route-count-cold-start-evidence.md`

## Read only

### Package context

- `LOW_CONTEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md`
- `GLOBAL_INVARIANTS.md`
- `context/milestones/M26.md`
- `context/components/qpack-router.md`
- `context/components/engine-scheduler.md`
- `context/components/schema-codecs.md`

### Source files

- `AGENTS.md`
- `crates/q-pack/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/q-bytecode-tool/src/main.rs`
- `crates/q-runtime/src/main.rs`

Do not scan unrelated directories unless a listed file imports a directly required implementation.

## Steps

1. Confirm the parent verification commit is present and the tree is clean.
2. Collect source paths, exact test names, command output, raw evidence, report paths, and commit hash.
3. Generate or update reports from raw evidence; never hand-edit values that should be generated.
4. Update the relevant beta/production task status only when every acceptance criterion is proven.
5. Check that review/evidence indexes and checksums identify the current commit.
6. Run the listed validation commands and commit only evidence/status changes.

## Parent acceptance guardrails

- No runtime router/schema compilation.
- No base64 decoding.
- 25-route budget is not sacrificed silently.
- 10,000-route scaling is documented honestly.

## Targeted commands

```bash
cargo test -p q-pack
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-engine-quickjs
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-schema-runtime
```
```bash
cargo test -p velqu-runtime
```
```bash
bun test
```
```bash
bun run typecheck
```
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
```bash
./scripts/verify
```

## Required evidence for this microtask

- Raw cold data.
- Generated report.
- Startup-stage trace.
- [ ] QPack v2 is deterministic, fail-closed, and version/fingerprint safe.
- [ ] Production startup maps verified runtime IR and raw bytecode without JSON/base64 reconstruction.
- [ ] Legacy compatibility is isolated.
- [ ] Shared and standalone artifacts pass conformance.
- [ ] Cold-start route scaling evidence is canonical.
- 25/100/1,000/5,000/10,000 route cold start.
- Shared vs standalone RSS/startup.
- Pack parse/allocation stages.
- Source vs bytecode selection.
- No full capability ecosystem.
- No Node compatibility.
- No multi-worker yet.

At minimum, the handoff must identify the exact changed files, test names, command results, and commit hash.

## Out of scope

- Changing runtime behavior except for an evidence-generation bug.
- Marking a parent PASS when any acceptance criterion is unproven.
- Using spot checks as canonical evidence.

## Commit guidance

## Stop condition

Stop after this task is committed and handed off. Do not automatically begin the next task.

## Handoff format

Use `templates/TASK_RESULT_TEMPLATE.md`. If blocked, use `templates/BLOCKER_TEMPLATE.md`.
