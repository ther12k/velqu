# M3-010-V — Verify Run multi-worker soak and recovery

## Atomic goal

Prove every acceptance criterion for parent task M3-010 without broadening scope.

## Parent intent

Prove sustained service stability and worker replacement.

## Dependencies

- `M3-010-A` — `tasks/06_m3_multi_worker/M3-010-A-run-multi-hour-mixed-load.md`
- `M3-010-B` — `tasks/06_m3_multi_worker/M3-010-B-inject-worker-poison-upstream-timeout-disconnect-and-shutdown.md`
- `M3-010-C` — `tasks/06_m3_multi_worker/M3-010-C-track-retained-memory-and-task-slot-counts.md`
- `M3-010-D` — `tasks/06_m3_multi_worker/M3-010-D-verify-recovery.md`

### Source files

Do not scan unrelated directories unless a listed file imports a directly required implementation.

## Steps

1. Confirm all implementation dependencies are present in the current branch.
2. Map every parent acceptance criterion to source and at least one positive or negative test.
3. Run targeted suites first, then the full verification commands listed below.
4. Inspect fail-before-ready behavior, cleanup paths, and evidence/source consistency where relevant.
5. Fix only defects necessary to satisfy this parent task; create a new follow-up task for unrelated findings.
6. Record exact commands and results, then commit the verification closure.

## Parent acceptance guardrails

- No monotonic leak.
- Capacity recovers after replacement.
- No boundary violations.
- All errors are bounded and explained.

## Targeted commands

```bash
cargo test -p q-engine-quickjs
```
```bash
cargo test -p velqu-runtime
```
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
```bash
./scripts/verify
```

## Required evidence for this microtask

- Soak raw data.
- Chaos timeline.
- Leak analysis.
- [ ] Independent workers scale across cores with bounded queues.
- [ ] Serverless mode preserves one-worker cold-start behavior.
- [ ] Quarantine/replacement and readiness are reliable.
- [ ] Cancellation/shutdown remain exact.
- [ ] Scaling, memory, fairness, and soak evidence pass.
- 1/2/4 worker C1/C2/C3.
- Controlled I/O at c=10/50/200.
- Mixed slow/fast fairness.
- Poison/replacement soak.
- No shared mutable JavaScript heap.
- No distributed cluster coordinator.
- No hostile tenant isolation claim.

At minimum, the handoff must identify the exact changed files, test names, command results, and commit hash.

## Out of scope

- Adding new features beyond the parent acceptance criteria.
- Marking the milestone gate PASS.
- Replacing raw evidence with a prose assertion.

## Commit guidance

## Stop condition

Stop after this task is committed and handed off. Do not automatically begin the next task.
