# M25-009-A — Fuzz encoded/decoded values

## Atomic goal

Fuzz encoded/decoded values.

## Parent intent

Prove generated codecs match reference semantics and remain memory-safe.

## Dependencies

- `M25-003-Z` — `tasks/02_m25_schema_codecs/M25-003-Z-package-evidence-for-generate-params-query-header-decoders.md`
- `M25-004-Z` — `tasks/02_m25_schema_codecs/M25-004-Z-package-evidence-for-generate-json-body-decoders.md`
- `M25-005-Z` — `tasks/02_m25_schema_codecs/M25-005-Z-package-evidence-for-generate-status-specific-response-encoders.md`
- `M25-006-Z` — `tasks/02_m25_schema_codecs/M25-006-Z-package-evidence-for-generate-rfc-9457-problem-encoders.md`

Do not scan unrelated directories unless a listed file imports a directly required implementation.

## Steps

1. Confirm every dependency is complete and the working tree is clean.
2. Read only the listed source files and the named milestone context card.
3. Find the existing behavior and its nearest tests; do not redesign adjacent subsystems.
4. Add or adjust the smallest test that proves this microtask when behavior or security changes.
5. Implement exactly this deliverable: Fuzz encoded/decoded values.
6. Run the targeted commands below and inspect failures rather than weakening assertions.
7. Review the diff for unrelated edits, formatting noise, generated artifacts, and hidden fallback behavior.
8. Commit one atomic change and return the required handoff.

## Parent acceptance guardrails

- No panic, hang, unbounded output, or semantic mismatch.
- All fuzz findings are triaged.
- Coverage targets are recorded.
- Generated code is deterministic.

## Targeted commands

```bash
cargo test -p q-pack
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-engine-quickjs
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-http
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-schema-runtime
```
```bash
bun test
```
```bash
bun run typecheck
```

## Required evidence for this microtask

- Fuzz summaries.
- Regression corpus.
- Differential report.

At minimum, the handoff must identify the exact changed files, test names, command results, and commit hash.

## Out of scope

- Other implementation bullets from the same parent task.
- Later milestones or optional features.
- Broad refactors not required by the acceptance criteria.
- Changing benchmark/report claims without raw evidence.

## Commit guidance

Suggested subject:

```text
m25-009-a: fuzz encoded decoded values
```

## Stop condition

Stop after this task is committed and handed off. Do not automatically begin the next task.

## Handoff format

Use `templates/TASK_RESULT_TEMPLATE.md`. If blocked, use `templates/BLOCKER_TEMPLATE.md`.
