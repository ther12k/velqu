# M4A-010-A — Provide clean install packet

## Atomic goal

Provide clean install packet.

## Parent intent

Find product friction before public beta.

## Dependencies

- `M4A-003-Z` — `tasks/07_m4a_developer_preview/M4A-003-Z-package-evidence-for-implement-project-scaffolding.md`
- `M4A-008-Z` — `tasks/07_m4a_developer_preview/M4A-008-Z-package-evidence-for-build-documentation-and-examples.md`
- `M4A-009-Z` — `tasks/07_m4a_developer_preview/M4A-009-Z-package-evidence-for-build-realistic-private-alpha-proof-service.md`

## Read only

### Package context

- `LOW_CONTEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md`
- `GLOBAL_INVARIANTS.md`
- `context/milestones/M4A.md`
- `context/components/qpack-router.md`
- `context/components/devex-beta.md`

### Source files

- `AGENTS.md`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/compiler/src/index.ts`
- `packages/treaty/src/index.ts`
- `packages/testing/src/index.ts`

Do not scan unrelated directories unless a listed file imports a directly required implementation.

## Steps

1. Confirm every dependency is complete and the working tree is clean.
2. Read only the listed source files and the named milestone context card.
3. Find the existing behavior and its nearest tests; do not redesign adjacent subsystems.
4. Add or adjust the smallest test that proves this microtask when behavior or security changes.
5. Implement exactly this deliverable: Provide clean install packet.
6. Run the targeted commands below and inspect failures rather than weakening assertions.
7. Review the diff for unrelated edits, formatting noise, generated artifacts, and hidden fallback behavior.
8. Commit one atomic change and return the required handoff.

## Parent acceptance guardrails

- Invited users can install, scaffold, run, test, and build without author intervention.
- No open alpha P0/P1.
- P2 backlog is explicit.
- Docs reflect observed confusion.

## Targeted commands

```bash
cargo test -p q-pack
```
```bash
bun test
```
```bash
bun run typecheck
```

## Required evidence for this microtask

- Feedback summary.
- Issue disposition.
- Re-run install evidence.
- [ ] Actual-runtime developer loop works.
- [ ] CLI, scaffolding, Treaty modes, diagnostics, and docs are usable.
- [ ] Proof service demonstrates real framework composition.
- [ ] Invited alpha users complete core tasks.
- [ ] No public beta claim yet.
- Dev reload latency.
- Typecheck/editor scale.
- Proof-service controlled I/O.
- Install/build artifact sizes.
- No SLA.
- No public production endorsement.
- Breaking API changes still allowed.

At minimum, the handoff must identify the exact changed files, test names, command results, and commit hash.

## Out of scope

- Other implementation bullets from the same parent task.
- Later milestones or optional features.
- Broad refactors not required by the acceptance criteria.
- Changing benchmark/report claims without raw evidence.

## Commit guidance

Suggested subject:

```text
m4a-010-a: provide clean install packet
```

## Stop condition

Stop after this task is committed and handed off. Do not automatically begin the next task.

## Handoff format

Use `templates/TASK_RESULT_TEMPLATE.md`. If blocked, use `templates/BLOCKER_TEMPLATE.md`.
