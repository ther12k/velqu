# BETA-017-Z — Package evidence for Resolve beta owner decisions

## Atomic goal

Create source-backed evidence and handoff for parent task BETA-017; update status only if verification passed.

## Parent intent

Close only the decisions necessary to publish a public beta.

## Dependencies

- `BETA-017-V` — `tasks/08_public_beta/BETA-017-V-verify-resolve-beta-owner-decisions.md`

## Read only

### Package context

- `LOW_CONTEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md`
- `GLOBAL_INVARIANTS.md`
- `context/milestones/BETA.md`
- `context/components/qpack-router.md`
- `context/components/engine-scheduler.md`
- `context/components/devex-beta.md`

### Source files

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/beta/`
- `scripts/verify`
- `package.json`
- `.github/workflows/verify.yml`
- `crates/q-pack/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/q-pack/tests/fuzz_pack.rs`
- `crates/q-bytecode-tool/src/main.rs`
- `docs/specs/pack-format-v1.md`
- `crates/q-engine-quickjs/src/worker.rs`
- `crates/q-engine-quickjs/src/prelude.rs`
- `crates/q-engine-quickjs/tests/engine.rs`

Do not scan unrelated directories unless a listed file imports a directly required implementation.

## Steps

1. Confirm the parent verification commit is present and the tree is clean.
2. Collect source paths, exact test names, command output, raw evidence, report paths, and commit hash.
3. Generate or update reports from raw evidence; never hand-edit values that should be generated.
4. Update the relevant beta/production task status only when every acceptance criterion is proven.
5. Check that review/evidence indexes and checksums identify the current commit.
6. Run the listed validation commands and commit only evidence/status changes.

## Parent acceptance guardrails

- Decisions are recorded in ADR/open-decision log.
- No agent invents owner authority.
- Security reporting channel exists.
- Platform/support scope is published.

## Targeted commands

```bash
cargo test -p q-pack
```
```bash
cargo test -p q-engine-quickjs
```
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
```bash
./scripts/verify
```
```bash
./scripts/validate-okf
```

## Required evidence for this microtask

- Accepted decision records.
- Release authorization.
- Contact/support document.
- [ ] No open beta P0/P1 findings or unapproved waivers.
- [ ] A clean external user can install, scaffold, develop, test, build, and deploy a real Velqu app.
- [ ] Fetch, multi-worker service mode, Treaty, optional Postgres, and auth reference work on the actual runtime.
- [ ] Real-world, cold, warm, and CPU/JIT evidence is reproducible and honestly reported.
- [ ] Security baseline, two-hour/one-million-request soak, observability, config, proxy/drain, and clean packaging pass.
- [ ] Release packet is self-verifying and owner decisions are closed.
- [ ] Release is labeled beta, non-SLA, trusted-code-only, and not production-ready GA.
- Canonical microbenchmarks with repetitions.
- Real PostgreSQL W1/W2/W3.
- Controlled I/O and fan-out.
- CPU/JIT crossover.
- 1/2/4 worker scaling.
- Two-hour/one-million-request soak.
- No GA/SLA claim.
- No full Node/Bun compatibility.
- No hostile tenant sandbox.
- No WebSocket/SSE.
- No ORM in core.
- No Windows/macOS support promise unless separately accepted.

At minimum, the handoff must identify the exact changed files, test names, command results, and commit hash.

## Out of scope

- Changing runtime behavior except for an evidence-generation bug.
- Marking a parent PASS when any acceptance criterion is unproven.
- Using spot checks as canonical evidence.

## Commit guidance
